2. Shortkeys:
   - N - next question
   - M - mark question
   - U - unmark question
   - R - revise marked questions
   - D - definitions

<sub> As of 4-Sep-2024, needs a local Deutsches Spiel server to be started due to impending CORs issues. But this step is not mandatory - at the lack of this setup, only word definitions can not be loaded; all other functionalities will run. </sub>
